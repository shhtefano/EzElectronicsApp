# Estimation approach
Consider the EZElectronics  project in FUTURE version (as proposed by your team in requirements V2), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course, and from scratch (not from V1)

# Estimate by size

| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |          43            |             
| A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC        | 4728 / 43 = 109 LOCs per class          | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)    | 43 * 109 = 4728 LOCs  |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | 4728 LOCs/10 LOCs per person hour = 472.8 person hours |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 472.8 person hours x 30 euro = 14.184â‚¬ | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 472.8 person hours/160 person hours per week = 2,95 weeks |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort(person hours)          |   Estimated duration (in weeks)for a team: 4 members, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week |          
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| estimate by size| 472.8                                     | 2.95 weeks     |
| estimate by product decomposition | 2660                    | 16.6 weeks     |
| estimate by activity decomposition| 2560                    | 16.0 weeks     |

Comments on the difference in estimated effort and duration:
- estimate by size - the estimated effort takes into account only the implementation part of the software, i.e. the effort related to Coding and Testing
- estimate by product decomposition - requirement analysis is also included in estimated duration
- estimate by activity decomposition - requirement analysis is also included in estimated duration
